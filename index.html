                                    I am currently in my last quarter as a B.S. Computer Science candidate at the University of California, San Diego. This past year I interned with BAE Systems as a Software Engineer. I experienced firsthand how different it is to develop software under an enterprise. I was tasked with developing the front end of a data migration tool using AngularJS and Bootstrap. During that time, I gained an in-depth knowledge of front-end work to supplement my education. Aside from technology, I love climbing and one day wish to boulder all around the world.

                            <h3>Problem</h3>
                            <p>Most cases of smoking takes places before a person finishes high school and they are more likely to continue smoking as adults. Anti-tobacco campaigns typically addresses important statistics to spread awareness. Smoking trends takes it a step further and gives life to these statistics. Smoking Trend is a web-based application that provides a hands on experience with the support of visualizations from the data. The goal is to find a trend between high school teens in San Diego and their ethnicity and income by visualizing it into four different graphs. By knowing the percentage of high school teens that smoke in each ethnicity, Smoking Trends compares it with areas of low and high income and the different ethnicities that occupy the area</p>
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <p>We decided to provide people with data and allowed them to create their own interpretations. In providing the data within our website, we can allow people to skip the over dramatic bedside scenes and scenes of teens sneaking around to try their first smoke. Our website allows the numbers to speak for themselves. Without the Hollywood fluff added, smokers can see just how badly their habit is affecting others. Non-smokers also benefit from our website by being able to see how difficult it can be to break out of the habit of smoking which can allow them to better understand why smoking is not recommended and how to possibly help a friend or family member to quit.
 Teenagers would also be more responsive to our data because there our website does not send a message not to smoke. It simply states the facts. In addition by allowing access to these facts on personal laptops and handheld devices, teenagers will feel like they are being pressured to agree to what their friends think about anti-smoking ads. They will be free to explore the website without judgment.</p>
 							<h3>Design Process</h3>
 							<p>Our design processes began with first creating various paper prototypes of what we envisioned our site would look like. We created various images of what we initially believed would be representative of the information we wanted to present without having a definitive idea of what information was available to us. These were rough sketches and ideas at the time.
 							<div class="row">
 								<div class="col-lg-3">
 									<img src="assets/images/portfolio/Paper1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
 								</div>
 								<div class="col-lg-3">
 									<img src="assets/images/portfolio/Paper2.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
 								</div>
 								<div class="col-lg-3">
 									<img src="assets/images/portfolio/Paper3.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
 								</div>
 								<div class="col-lg-3">
 									<img src="assets/images/portfolio/Paper4.PNG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
 								</div>
 							</div>

Our next step was to go a little more in-depth in planning out our website and create high-fidelity models using Axure.

We then received feedback on both of the models and were told that our data from the Delphi team may not end up looking like what we had assumed we would receive.

After we were finally able to view the data, we had a better sense of what we can do with the data. At first we thought the data would be more detailed and had maybe more variety than 4 ethnic groups and more years, which is how our prototypes were based on and fixed up our Axure models.

							<div class="row">
 								<div class="col-lg-3">
 									<img src="assets/images/portfolio/Axure1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
 								</div>
 								<div class="col-lg-3">
 									<img src="assets/images/portfolio/Axure2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
 								</div>
 								<div class="col-lg-3">
 									<img src="assets/images/portfolio/Axure3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
 								</div>
 								<div class="col-lg-3">
 									<img src="assets/images/portfolio/Axure4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
 								</div>
 							</div>

Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. We had to adjust our design to involve more interaction so that our site would be more attractive to other users. We went into our 2nd round of prototypes knowing exactly what the data was and how we would be able to relate all the data together to make it feel more connected. This would give our date the purpose it was intended to have. We didn’t want to make it seem lackluster with correlations that seemed to be random data joined together just to have something to show. 

We needed to find a meaning or a relationship so that the users can have a good experience and get something back from our site. 

We still wanted the data to be the priority and we didn’t want anything to stand in the way of that. So we eliminated all the clutter and noise that would take away from the data and made the site so that the data can be clearly seen. 

We also wanted the user have a good experience because they were mainly interacting with the data graphs and visualizations. We thought it would be interesting if we created some more interactions such as a flash game that could be educational, but then we thought about its feasibility. We decided on creating something similar to a buzzfeed quiz. This would be able to show how likely you might smoke based off of similar traits that we found, such as smoking cause of stress, smoking because of peer pressure, smoking cause of the people around them, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend, significant other. 

Towards the end of the term, we were finally able to begin development on the website. We decided to use node.js as our framework and d3.js as well as c3.js for our data visualizations. The end results show a fully functioning website that allows users to gain awareness over these smoking trends while having an interactive experience.

                            <p>Homii is a housing/roommate search web application born from field research and interviews. User needs were assessed and analyzed from the collected data to determine the most needed tool on everyone's mind. Our target audience of students wanted to be able to not only find places to rent, but roommated to live with due to many of their financial circumstances. This website was thus designed with the key feature of roommate matching. After field-research, we created story boards to better show how each indivual viewed this particular problem then continued on with the creation of low-fidelity protoypes using Balsamiq. From there, we performed user testings in order to gain feedback and design a finalized hi-fidelity prototype with Axure.</p>
